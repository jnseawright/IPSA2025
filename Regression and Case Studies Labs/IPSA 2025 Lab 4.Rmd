# Lab 4: Mixed-Method Research

*Inequality and Democracy, Again*

Recall this regression from the second lab session:

```{r, results='hide'}
inequality <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnseawright/practice-of-multimethod/main/data/inequality.csv")

ineqlm2 <- lm(Gini ~ Polity + log(GDP), data=inequality)
summary(ineqlm2)
```

Devise a research plan for case-study analysis that could test key
causal inference assumptions for this regression, using resources
available to you from this lab. The two cases you should focus on are
the Republic of Yemen and Zimbabwe. Describe the research you have
designed to test each assumption of interest, carry out your plan, and
discuss any modifications to the regression analysis that your research
implies.


*Design a Multi-Method Follow-Up*

<https://doi.org/10.1080/21565503.2021.1992287> Carefully determine what is being
assumed in order to make the causal inferences that are made in this study. Which 
assumptions of those assumptions could potentially be tested using in-depth interviews? 
Design an in-depth interview schedule to test as
many assumptions of the model as possible. For each part of the
interview, explain what multi-method task it is intended to fulfill and
clarify the qualitative causal inferential strategy connected with it.

Now, find someone in the class and administer your interview. Take
careful notes, analyze your results, and describe any issues for the
model that arise from your interview. What next steps would you take if
you wanted to pursue this line of research further?

*Design a Multi-Method Follow-Up*

Find a published regression-based study on a topic of your interest.
Design a suite of qualitative research components to test the key
assumptions behind causal inference for that study. Be as detailed as
possible about the sorts of findings you will look for, the data sources
you will draw on, and so forth. When you have completed work on your
design, find a partner. Present your design to your partner, and also
offer a constructive critique of your partner's design.

*Discussion Questions*

Find an example of research using regression in a way that you regard as
successful from your area of research. What makes this application of
regression successful? What is regression used for, what assumptions are
needed, and to what extent do you regard the results as credible?

What difference does it make for the qualitative part of multi-method
causal inference when the cases under study are historical vs.
contemporary? What about when they are individuals vs. organizations vs.
countries?

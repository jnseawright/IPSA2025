### Typology of Natural Experiments

-   Classic Natural Experiment

-   Instrumental Variables-Type Natural Experiment

-   Regression-Discontinuity Design


---
### Classic Natural Experiment

1.  "Nature" randomizes the treatment.

    -   All (observable and unobservable) confounding variables are
        balanced between treatment and control groups.

    -   No discretion is involved in assigning treatments, or the
        relevant information is unavailable or unused.

2.  Randomized treatment has the same effect as non-randomized treatment
    would have.


---
### Classic Natural Experiment

-   Process tracing and the cause of the cause.

-   Process tracing to compare mechanisms inside and outside of the
    natural experiment.

### IV Natural Experiment

1.  "Nature" randomizes a cause of the treatment.

    -   Call the treatment $X$.

    -   Call the randomized cause of the treatment $Z$.

2.  $Z$ only affects $Y$ through its effects on $X$.

3.  Treatment caused by the randomized cause has the same effect as
    treatment with any other cause would have.


---
### IV Natural Experiment

-   Process tracing backwards from the cause of the cause.

-   Process tracing forward from the cause of the cause to the cause.

-   Process tracing between the cause and the outcome in a matched pair
    of cases.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height="100%", fig.retina = 1, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("img/PierskallaInstrumentResults.JPG")
```

---
### RDD

1.  There is an assignment variable, $Z$.

2.  Cases are assigned to treatment if and only if $Z$ is greater than a
    predetermined threshold value, $T$.

3.  There are enough cases that lots have scores of $Z$ that are just
    above and just below $T$.


---
### RDD

-   Assumptions 1 and 3 can be checked with the quantitative data.

-   For assumption 2, process trace the cause of the cause and the cause
    of the cause of the cause.

### Example: Maimonides' Rule

> "The number of pupils assigned to each teacher is twenty-five. If
> there are fifty, we appoint two teachers. If there are forty, we
> appoint an assistant, at the expense of the town." (Baba Bathra,
> Chapter II, page 21a; translated by Epstein 1976: 214)


---
### Example: Maimonides' Rule

> "Twenty-five children may be put in charge of one teacher. If the
> number in the class exceeds twenty-five but is not more than forty, he
> should have an assistant to help with the instruction. If there are
> more than forty, two teachers must be appointed." (Maimonides, given
> in Hyamson 1937: 58b)

```


---
### RDD

RDD isn't a good idea if:

-   Actors are aware of the discontinuity and adjust their behavior
    accordingly.

-   The variable which assigns the discontinuity is so coarsely measured
    or distributed that the cases nearest to the divide are not close to
    each other.


---
### Case Selection and Natural Experiments

-   Classic natural experiments: extreme values of the cause

-   IV natural experiments: extreme values of the cause of the cause;
    surprising values of the cause

-   RDD natural experiments: cases with power or privilege

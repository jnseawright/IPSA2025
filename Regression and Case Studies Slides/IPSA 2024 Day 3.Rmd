### Discussion: Regression Lab


---
### The Diversity of Qualitative Research

-   Historical methods

-   In-depth interviews

-   Focus groups

-   Participant observation

-   Close reading of texts


---
### Focus Groups

-   Research method devoted to data collection

-   Interaction in a group discussion is the source of the data

-   The researcher actively creates the group discussion


---
### Focus Groups

-   Allow in-depth exploration of complex behaviors and ideas

-   Provide fine-grained detail regarding reasons for and scope of
    disagreement among participants


---
### Focus Groups vis-a-vis Surveys


---
### Focus Groups vis-a-vis Individual Interviews


---
### Project-Level Design Issues

-   Standardization

-   Sampling

-   Number of Groups


---
### Group-Level Design Issues

-   Level of Moderator Involvement

-   Group Size


---
### When Case Studies Directly Illuminate Counterfactuals


---
### Threats

-   History

-   Maturation

-   Testing

-   Instrumentation

-   Instability

-   Regression

### CPOs and the Potential Outcomes Framework

Bayes' Rule

$$P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \sim H) P(\sim H)}$$


---
### Examples

-   Brady on Florida 2000

-   Tannenwald on the Nuclear Taboo


---
### Bennett and Checkel's Standards

-   Cast the net widely for alternative explanations

-   Be equally tough on the alternative explanations

-   Consider the potential biases of evidentiary sources

-   Take into account whether the case is most or least likely for
    alternative explanations

-   Make a justifiable decision on when to start


---
### Bennett and Checkel's Standards

-   Be relentless in gathering diverse and relevant evidence, but make a
    justifiable decision on when to stop

-   Combine process tracing with case comparisons when useful for the
    research goal and feasible

-   Be open to inductive insights

-   Use deduction to ask: \"if my explanation is true, what will be the
    specific process leading to the outcome?\"

-   Remember that conclusive process tracing is good, but not all good
    process tracing is conclusive


---
### Measurement's Contribution to Causal Inference

-   Can causal inference be done correctly if $T_{i}$ is miscoded?

-   Can causal inference be done correctly if $Y_{i}$ is miscoded?


---
### Qualitative Approaches to Measurement

-   Cases and concepts

-   Attention to tensions between and limits of sources

-   Attention to subjectivity

-   Breadth of information

-   Expert Judgment


---
### Qualitative Approaches to Measurement

Example: Fourcade on the professional structure of economics


---
### Process Tracing 2: Following Causal Flows


---
### Example: Stokes on Fujimori


---
### Example: Prasad on Reagan


---
### Finding New Variables


---
### Cross-Case Comparison

For causal inference from a paired comparison of case $i$ with case $j$:

$$Y_{i,t} = Y_{j,t}$$

$$Y_{i,c} = Y_{j,c}$$

---
-   Conceptual innovation and clarification

-   Prevalence of key causal capacities

-   Theorybuilding about moderation


---
### Common Assumptions

-   Key links in process-tracing chain are genuinely causal

-   Events in this case reflect broad causal principles

-   In comparative analysis, the dependent variable is measured
    comparably
